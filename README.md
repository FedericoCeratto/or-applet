## or-applet - A Gtk+ Tor System Tray applet
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

### What?

This is a Stem/pygobject based Tor controller.  It primarily exists so I can
get quick info out of the system Tor instance on my laptop, if it happens to be
useful for other people, that's great.

### Dependencies

 * [pygobject3](https://wiki.gnome.org/PyGObject)
 * [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/)

The versions used for development are pygobject 3.12 and Stem 1.2, other
versions are not supported.

### WON'T DO

 * Go out of my way to support OSes/distributions I don't use.  Patches
   accepted.
 * Anything involving the words "GeoIP".  I don't reduce my anonymity set by
   enaging in StrictExitNodes/ExitNodes tinfoil-hattery.
